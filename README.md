## Generic-Image-Handling-Ada

This Ada library is a simple image file handling and data processing package, wrapping the [stb_images.h header library](https://github.com/nothings/stb). It exposes a reference-counted image handle type which can be used to load, manipulate and save images to/from files. Supported file types are `PNG`, `JPEG`, `TGA` and `BMP`.

Refer to the included example project for a simple use case of the library's core features.
